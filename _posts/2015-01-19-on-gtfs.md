[Transit agencies](https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds) around the world publish internal service data for public consumption according to a common standard called the [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/). 

By adopting a shared data architecture, these agencies promote and support a vibrant, unified ecosystem of transit developers and software applications.
